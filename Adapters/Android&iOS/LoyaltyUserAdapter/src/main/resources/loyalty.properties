WATSON_STRING=This weekend was filled with spontaneous shopping activities. I'm not really a homebody at all, so I'm always looking for fun adventures on the weekends. I think it's because of my outgoing personality that I can't see myself staying indoors. I like meeting new people and doing fun activities and I like shopping. Shopping makes me feel happy and lively. Sight of Discount coupons really makes me want to go for shopping immediately. I saw a 50% coupon at American Apparel in the mail and decided to head out for another shopping trip. RIP credit card haha. I honestly get lucky with finding the best deals and offers as I have a good eye for these things. I went to Forever 21 first because I had to return something. While returning my clothes, I spotted a ridiculous sale for accessories. I ended up buying tons of must have accessories like earrings, bracelets, and necklaces. They were beautiful and lovely when I tried them on. I have all these new items that I bought piling at home and I gotta clean up the old ones or else I am not going to have any place to keep the new stuff that I am going to buy. Then I wandered over to H&M because there was a nice purse on display there. I just had to get it. Also didn't help that I had some store credit that needed to be used up. I went to a couple more stores to try on dresses. I'm a complete impulsive shopper. If I see anything good, I buy them off immediately. Do not think of the cost much. The other day, I bought some expensive jeans while waiting in line at the food court. It was an impulsive buy because there was a deal expiring that very day. I don't think twice before buying stuff. Case in point, two weeks ago, I did some major credit card damage at the outlets. Just had an impulse to do some retail therapy after bombing my final. The deals are always just too good to pass up! I save a ton of coupons from previous visits and since they were expiring soon, I decided to take advantage. I have a massive credit card bill that I'm too scared to open. I know it's completely irresponsible and careless and will eventually haunt me. But hey, you're only young once. Gotta live life on the edge! And I don't really have money to pay it off right now since I'm in school. I found out that the outlets have their own rewards/loyalty program that they started offering recently. I can't even keep track of how many rewards programs I'm a part of. I had to sign up to make sure I get the best deals. I try to be proactive about sales, so here are some guidelines: 1) Discounts, Discounts The cheaper, the better! We love the numbers on those SALES signs! 2) Shopping suddenly becomes a competition! Just when someone was about to grab that last pair of shoes, you got your hands on it! WIN! 3) The more, the merrier! The more you can buy, the better! Can't choose between 3 dresses? Buy them all, have fun, enjoy! That's what sales are for! 4) Retail Therapy just became a lot cheaper! Uplift your mood in the best possible way plus, it's not hard on your wallet this time! 5) It brings out the shopaholic in you! The crazy shopping addict that's been hiding in there all along is finally unleashed grabbing things off the rack, racing to the long pay-counter lines and carrying bags and bags of stuff that you know will make your WEEK!
